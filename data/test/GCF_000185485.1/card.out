ArlR must first be phosphorylated by ArlS.

It shares 30% similarity with NorA and is a structural homolog of Bmr of Bacillus subtilis. It is regulated by arlRS and mgrA the latter also known as NorR.

It is a positive regulator for norA expression but is a direct repressor for norB and an indirect repressor of tet38.

It is typically found in plasmid DNA.
